# Artemis Financial: Secure Software Report

## Client and Issue Addressed
The client, Artemis Financial was in need of improvements for the security of their software. This primarily focused on protecting financial data which was accomplished through encryption and secure communication. 

I significantly enhanced software security by implementing robust measures, including AES-256 encryption for data protection, SHA-256 hashing to ensure data integrity, and HTTPS to secure communications. Utilizing the OWASP Dependency Check, I conducted static security analysis to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within dependencies. This multi-layered approach, combining strong encryption, hashing, secure transmission, and proactive vulnerability detection, effectively fortified the application against potential threats.  Overcoming challenges in dependency risk identification and cryptographic implementation, I focused on maintaining both functionality and security. Rigorous functional and secondary testing confirmed that code changes did not introduce new vulnerabilities or disrupt existing features.

To showcase these achievements to potential employers, I will highlight my practical application of secure coding practices and encryption techniques, demonstrating my ability to identify and mitigate software vulnerabilities. I'll emphasize my proficiency with security testing tools like OWASP Dependency Check and my commitment to documenting and communicating security measures effectively. Furthermore, I will outline my plans to incorporate advanced security assessments, such as penetration testing with tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite, and threat modeling, demonstrating a continuous drive for security improvement. This comprehensive approach underscores my dedication to building secure and reliable software.
